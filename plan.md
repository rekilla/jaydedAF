# Implementation Plan

## Task: Remove all instances of "BottleNexus"

### Goals:
1. Identify all files containing the string "BottleNexus".
2. Remove all occurrences of "BottleNexus" from these files.
3. Verify that all instances have been removed.

### Steps:

- [ ] **List all files in the project:** Use `list_files` to get a comprehensive list of all files in the `d:/WebDev/jayded-af-cocktails` directory.
- [ ] **Search for "BottleNexus":** Use `search_files` with a regex to find all occurrences of "BottleNexus" across all files.
- [ ] **Remove "BottleNexus" from files:** For each file identified in the previous step, use `replace_in_file` to remove all instances of "BottleNexus".
- [ ] **Verify removal:** After making changes, re-run the search for "BottleNexus" to confirm that all instances have been removed.
- [ ] **Attempt completion:** Once verified, use `attempt_completion` to finalize the task.
